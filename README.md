## Code Description

The TrendMaster FX MT4 code is designed to incorporate a neural network learning model to analyze market trends and make trading decisions based on predictions. The code consists of the following functions:

### `OnInit()`

This function is executed when the Expert Advisor (EA) is initialized. It initializes the neural network learning model, loads historical data for training, trains the model, and optimizes the model parameters. It also enables market analysis and algorithmic trading strategies.

### `EnableMarketAnalysis()`

This function is responsible for analyzing market trends using the neural network model. It retrieves market data, loops through historical data to make predictions, and makes trading decisions based on the predictions. If the prediction is above a threshold of 0.5, a buy order is placed. If the prediction is below -0.5, a sell order is placed.

### `EnableAlgorithmicTrading()`

This function automates trading based on predefined criteria and signals from the model. It retrieves market data, loops through recent data to make trading decisions, and places buy or sell orders based on predictions and predefined criteria. If the prediction is above a threshold of 0.7 and the current close price is higher than the open price, a buy order is placed. If the prediction is below -0.7 and the current close price is lower than the open price, a sell order is placed.

### `OnDeinit(const int reason)`

This function is executed when the EA is deinitialized. It cleans up and deinitializes the neural network model.

### `OnTick()`

This function is executed on each tick and handles incoming ticks and updates trading decisions. This function is left blank as it depends on the specific implementation.
